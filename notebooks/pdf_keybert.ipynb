    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of a _Hybrid Knowledge Store_.\n",
    "This combines the benefits of a traditional vector store (locating nodes by vector similarity) with the benefits of a knowledge graph (connecting relevant but not necessarily similar information).\n",
    "\n",
    "It demonstrates loading a PDF, chunking it and writing it to the Knowledge Store using the standard LangChain patterns.\n",
    "The only addition is the extraction of \"keywords\" using [keybert](https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/index.html).\n",
    "This demonstrates how chunks may be linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ways that chunks could be linked:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using TF-IDF to compute keywords from chunks, rather than keybert.\n",
    "- Using links (`<a href=\"...\">`) in the content and associated URLs to connect explicit links. This would even work with anchors within a page!\n",
    "- Connecting images and tables on a page to the other content on the page."

The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines.

Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [ 1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8].

Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing.

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience.

Many previous works [ 26,30,27]\\nand tools18have been developed to identify and parse table structures.

Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\n\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2.A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\\n3.Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\\n4.A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip.

Mask R-CNN [ 12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [ 38] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering\\nout model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions,\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly\\nsimpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser , the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\\non a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated,\\n\\nLayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 5\\nTable 1: Current layout detection models in the LayoutParser model zoo\\nDataset Base Model1Large Model Notes\\nPubLayNet [38] F / M M Layouts of modern scientiﬁc documents\\nPRImA [3] M - Layouts of scanned modern magazines and scientiﬁc reports\\nNewspaper [17] F - Layouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century\\nTableBank [18] F F Table region on modern scientiﬁc and business document\\nHJDataset [31] F / M - Layouts of history Japanese documents\\n1For each dataset, we train several models of diﬀerent sizes for diﬀerent needs (the trade-oﬀ between accuracy\\nvs. computational cost).

However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\n\\n423–428.

This allows a layout dataset to be created more\\neﬃciently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.\\nAfter the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports diﬀerent modes\\nfor training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a\\nsmall newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained\\nweights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\\ntarget are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as\\nsuggested in Studer et al.’s work[ 33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\\ndatasets like ImageNet [ 5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost\\nmodel performance.

Using the highly\\nﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser , a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser . The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\n\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1.An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\n\\n10 Z.

Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\n\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n5 Use Cases\\nThe core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\\nand light-weight document digitization pipelines. Large-scale document processing\\n\\nrated by white spaces of variable size,\\nand the vertical positions of objects\\ncan be an indicator of their layout\\ntype.\\n15A document page consists of eight rows like this. For simplicity we skip the row\\nsegmentation discussion and refer readers to the source code when available.\\n\\nLayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for Deep\\nLearning Based Document Image Analysis\\nZejiang Shen1( \\u0000), Ruochen Zhang2, Melissa Dell3, Benjamin Charles Germain\\nLee4, Jacob Carlson3, and Weining Li5\\n1Allen Institute for AI\\nshannons@allenai.org\\n2Brown University\\nruochen zhang@brown.edu\\n3Harvard University\\n{melissadell,jacob carlson }@fas.harvard.edu\\n4University of Washington\\nbcgl@cs.washington.edu\\n5University of Waterloo\\nw422li@uwaterloo.ca\\nAbstract.

This allows a layout dataset to be created more\\neﬃciently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.\\nAfter the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports diﬀerent modes\\nfor training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a\\nsmall newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained\\nweights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\\ntarget are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as\\nsuggested in Studer et al.’s work[ 33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\\ndatasets like ImageNet [ 5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost\\nmodel performance. Through the integrated API provided by LayoutParser ,\\nusers can easily compare model performances on the benchmark datasets.\\n\\ntrained on these datasets are currently available in the LayoutParser model zoo\\nto support diﬀerent use cases.\\n3 The Core LayoutParser Library\\nAt the core of LayoutParser is an oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit that streamlines DL-\\nbased document image analysis. Five components support a simple interface\\nwith comprehensive functionalities: 1) The layout detection models enable using\\npre-trained or self-trained DL models for layout detection with just four lines\\nof code. 2) The detected layout information is stored in carefully engineered\\n\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser , an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines.

Shen et al.\\n6 Conclusion\\nLayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document\\nimage analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to\\nbuild ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated\\nstructures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and\\ntraining of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser\\ncommunity platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting\\ndiscussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser\\nteam is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing\\nthe most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document\\nmodeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.\\nAcknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments\\nand suggestions.

Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\n\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n5 Use Cases\\nThe core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\\nand light-weight document digitization pipelines.

Five components support a simple interface\\nwith comprehensive functionalities: 1) The layout detection models enable using\\npre-trained or self-trained DL models for layout detection with just four lines\\nof code. 2) The detected layout information is stored in carefully engineered\\n\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8,34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts.

Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n5 Use Cases\\nThe core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\\nand light-weight document digitization pipelines. Large-scale document processing\\n\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [ 12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser , built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1import layoutparser as lp\\n2image = cv2. imread (\\\" image_file \\\") # load images\\n3model = lp. Detectron2LayoutModel (\\n4 \\\"lp :// PubLayNet / faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x / config \\\")\\n5layout = model . detect ( image )\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\ndomain shift [ 7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset.
